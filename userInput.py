#User Inputs, using the input method we can get the user to input through the console
#example
name = input("What is your name :") #input is always  string
age = int(input("What is your age : "))
height = float(input("What is your height : "))

age += 1
height += 0.5
print("Your name is " +name+ ", your age is " +str(age)+ ", your height is " +str(height)+ ".")
